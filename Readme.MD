## Notes
CoRL Day 2

Presentation: ImMimic

Hand data --> Youtube videos -->skeleton or extraction of the hand pose
Retargeted to a particular hand
Motion is transferred. However, there are some limitations, the motion transfer process is not very accurate. Linear interpolation is used to retarget the data mismatch. say between 5 fingers captured to 3 fingers.
